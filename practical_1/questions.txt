-what is the size of the paddle in the p.setSize?
-what is the the origin of the paddle? why calculated by /2?
-is a vector's member accessed usign .x and .y?
-when getting position of element, where is the 0,0 position?
-why when checking for bouncing on the paddles it is - (paddleSize.y*0.5)
-why is it -3 on .setSize and .setRadius?
-not sure when checking ball bouncing on paddle why it is used the paddleSize (since the paddle is moved by 10 from left side screen
  and when getting the ball position should not give the center of the ball? So it is needed to calculate the radius in order to understand
  when the ball left side will touch the paddle)

-how is calculated the dt?
